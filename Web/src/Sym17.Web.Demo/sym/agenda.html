Funding was provided to translate one million words, and the charge was given to cover as much of the site as it would allow. Mayoclinic.org, which is built on Sitecore, went live in March 2017 with a Spanish version, and a project has been launched to provide an Arabic site within the next year. The team at Mayo Clinic would like to share the tools they used, the challenges they encountered, and their lessons learned with the Sitecore community. After this presentation, the audience will have a new perspective on what considerations they should take into account as they embark upon a multilingual project using Sitecore. They will also have sample code snippets and tips to get past potential difficulties, and tips about certain settings that can help their efforts.</span></td></tr><tr><td>Daniel Cozine &amp; Melinda Klein Mayo Clinic<br><i>Bermuda AB</i></td></tr></tbody></table>
